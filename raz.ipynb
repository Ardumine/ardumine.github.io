       "\"\\r\\n        INGRIDIENTS: · Flour: This homemade pancake recipe starts with\\r\\n        all-purpose flour. · Baking powder: Baking powder, a leavener, is the\\r\\n        secret to fluffy pancakes. · Sugar: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is\\r\\n        all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes. · Salt: A pinch of salt will\\r\\n        enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty. ·\\r\\n        Milk and butter: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the\\r\\n        pancakes. · Egg: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps\\r\\n        bind the pancake batter together. 1. Sift the dry ingredients together.\\r\\n        2. Make a well, then add the wet ingredients. Stir to combine. 3. Scoop\\r\\n        the batter onto a hot griddle or pan. 4. Cook for two to three minutes,\\r\\n        then flip. 5. Continue cooking until brown on both sides.\\r\\n      \""
